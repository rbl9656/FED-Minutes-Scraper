System Overview:

Three-component pipeline with clear separation of concerns:

scraper.py → validators.py → transformers.py
   ↓            ↓              ↓
Raw Data → Quality Check → Market Intelligence

Core Design Principles:

1. Modularity: Each component works independently
2. Respectful Scraping: 5-second delays, exponential backoff  
3. **Fail-Safe: Partial failures don't stop the pipeline
4. **Data Quality: Multi-layer validation before analysis

Component Architecture:

scraper.py: Data Acquisition
class FOMCDocument:  Type-safe data structure
class FEDScraper:    Main orchestrator

- Exponential backoff: 5s - 10s - 20s retry delays
- Session reuse**: Connection pooling for efficiency  
- Cascading selectors: Robust parsing across Fed website changes
- Dataclasses: Type safety over dictionaries

validators.py - Quality Assurance: 

class ValidationResult:  # Structured quality metrics
class FEDDataValidator:  # Multi-dimensional validation

- Multiplicative scoring: All dimensions must pass (structure × participants × policy × technical)
- Flexible thresholds: 70% = VALID, 40% = WARNING, <40% = INVALID
- Lenient matching: Partial section matches handle document variations
- Expected members: Validates against known FOMC composition

transformers.py - Business IntelligenceL

class PolicySignal:     # Hawkish/dovish detection
class AnalysisResult:   # Comprehensive market analysis

- Dual signal detection: Separate hawkish/dovish term dictionaries
- Confidence weighting: Frequency × context determines signal strength
- Sentiment normalization: -1 (dovish) to +1 (hawkish) scale
- Context windows: 50-character snippets for evidence

Data Flow:

1. Extract: Calendar → Document URLs → Content scraping
2. Validate: Structure + Participants + Policy + Technical quality
3. Transform: Policy signals → Economic indicators → Market implications

Technical Decisions:

HTTP - requests.Session() - Connection pooling, header persistence
Parsing - BeautifulSoup - Handles malformed HTML gracefully
Data - @dataclass - Type safety + auto-serialization
Retry - Exponential backoff - Industry standard for respectful scraping
Validation - Multi-dimensional - Financial data requires high quality
Analysis - Term categorization - Captures nuanced Fed language

Performance Features:

- Memory efficient: Streaming processing, no accumulation
- Network optimized: Session reuse, connection pooling
- Scalable: Stateless design, configurable parameters
- Resilient: Multiple fallback strategies for parsing

Error Handling:

try:
    content = primary_extraction_method()
except:
    content = fallback_extraction_method()

Strategy: Partial success > complete failure

Configuration Points:

self.request_delay = 5          # Rate limiting
self.max_retries = 3           # Failure tolerance  
self.retry_backoff_factor = 2  # Exponential growth
self.timeout = 30              # Request timeout

Output Architecture:

- Raw JSON: Complete scraped data with metadata
- Analysis JSON: Market intelligence and signals  
- Executive TXT: Human-readable business summary

Security & Compliance:

- Public domain: Fed documents, no privacy concerns
- Rate limiting: Built-in delays prevent abuse
- Input sanitization: URL validation, HTML stripping
- Respectful scraping: Follows web scraping best practices
