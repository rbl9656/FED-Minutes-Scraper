The proposed Fed minutes scraping and sentiment analysis platform is legally well-grounded, since the underlying FOMC minutes are works of the U.S. federal government and therefore in the public domain under 17 U.S.C. §105. This means there are no copyright restrictions on copying, redistributing, or analyzing these materials. Case law such as hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn (938 F.3d 985, 9th Cir. 2019) has further established that scraping publicly available web content does not violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. §1030) so long as no authentication barriers are circumvented. While website Terms of Service may create some contractual risk if they prohibit automated access, government websites typically have minimal restrictions on public information, and no special licensing is required to commercialize derivative analytics products built on Fed communications. Importantly, this project avoids securities law concerns, as it relies entirely on public data and does not involve insider or selectively disclosed information regulated under SEC Regulation FD (17 C.F.R. §243.100).

Operationally, the main consideration is the potential impact on the Federal Reserve’s website. Because the FOMC minutes are published on predictable schedules and in large, static files, scraping them once per release imposes negligible load compared to abusive high-frequency scraping. To ensure continued goodwill and technical stability, best practices include respecting robots.txt, rate limiting, and caching documents after retrieval. From a privacy standpoint, there is no personally identifiable information in the minutes themselves, and therefore essentially no risk under frameworks such as HIPAA or FERPA. The only privacy obligations that may arise will concern the platform’s own users, in which case compliance with the FTC Act §5, state-level privacy laws such as California’s CCPA/CPRA (Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100), and potentially the GDPR if serving European clients, should be ensured.

From an ethical perspective, the project creates value by broadening access to high-quality analysis of Fed communications, historically accessible only to institutions able to afford Bloomberg or Refinitiv subscriptions. By scraping responsibly, offering transparent methodology in sentiment scoring, and avoiding exploitative data handling, the platform can uphold fairness, transparency, and responsible use of public resources. Alternative approaches—such as leveraging RSS feeds, using official PDF downloads instead of direct scraping, or forming partnerships with existing data providers—could further reduce operational risk while still enabling real-time analysis. In sum, the project poses minimal legal and ethical concerns and offers an opportunity to democratize institutional-quality monetary policy insights, provided that technical safeguards and privacy-conscious practices are embedded into its design.
